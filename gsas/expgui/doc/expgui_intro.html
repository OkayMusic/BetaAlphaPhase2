<B>What is EXPGUI?</B><P>
<blockquote>
EXPGUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) editor for 
<A Href="http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/programs/crystallography/software/gsas.html">
GSAS</A>
experiment (.EXP) files and shell which allows all the other GSAS programs
to be executed with a GUI.
EXPGUI is not a replacement for the GSAS program EXPEDT.
EXPGUI can do at best 10% of what 
EXPEDT can do -- but that 10% covers most of the
actions that I use frequently (and that I could code without a major effort).
EXPGUI is written in the
<A Href="http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/programs/crystallography/software/tclpkgs.html">Tcl/Tk</A> scripting language, so it is largely platform independent.

<P><B>So what can EXPGUI do?</B>
<blockquote>
<dt>
<i>Phase parameters</i>: EXPGUI can edit the cell and atomic parameters
as well as the cell and atomic damping and refinement flags.</dt>
<IMG SRC="note.gif" alt="Note!">
Create new .EXP files, adding phases and atoms. 
<IMG SRC="new.gif" alt="New!">
Edit/Delete/Transform atom(s).

<P><dt>
<i>Histogram parameters</i>: Scale factor, background, diffractometer constants,
phase fractions, profile terms can all be changed.</dt>
<IMG SRC="note.gif" alt="Note!">Add additional histograms.
<IMG SRC="new.gif" alt="New!">Change peak profile functions.

<P><dt>
<i>Least-Squares options:</i> control the number of cycles, the print options
and F<sub>obs</sub> extraction parameters.</dt>

<BR><IMG SRC="note.gif" alt="Note!">
Editing and creating [hard] constraints on atomic and profile parameters.

<BR><IMG SRC="note.gif" alt="Note!">
Create and edit March-Dollase preferred orientation parameters.

<BR><IMG SRC="note.gif" alt="Note!">
Create and edit Generalized Spherical Harmonic (ODF) preferred orientation parameters.

<BR><IMG SRC="note.gif" alt="Note!">
Modify Phase flags for each histogram
<BR><IMG SRC="new.gif" alt="New!">    
Edit excluded data regions and the range of data used in the fit.

</dt>

</blockquote>

<p><br><B>So what can't EXPGUI do?</B>
<blockquote>Much more than it can do. At this time, EXPGUI can't 
change atom types.
It cannot create or edit soft constraints
or many types of hard constraints (other than atomic and profile constraints). 
It cannot be used on
magnetic scattering parameters or on single-crystal histograms. 
It does do most of the things that commonly used in Rietveld. 
<p>New features are planned for EXPGUI, but this depends on my 
available free time. It should be noted that the GSAS EXPEDT program is
huge, so EXPGUI will never have all the features in EXPEDT. 
I am glad to get suggestions for adding more functionality to EXPGUI 
(see the 
<A HREF="wishlist.html">"wish list"</A>). Coming up with 
ideas for intuitive GUI additions
is often half the battle.
</blockquote>

<p><br><B>What type of computers will EXPGUI run on?</B>
<blockquote>EXPGUI requires a working version of
<A Href="http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/programs/crystallography/software/tclpkgs.html">Tcl/Tk</A>, scripting language.
While that is somewhat restrictive,
it still means that EXPGUI will run on many more platforms than GSAS does.
Most of the development has been done in LINUX with some testing on SGI. It 
also runs in Windows (-95 through -XP & -2003?) and in Mac OS X.
I expect that EXPGUI will run on all platforms
where GSAS does (except perhaps VMS).</blockquote>

<p><br><B>Where do I get EXPGUI?</B>
<blockquote>See the 
<A HREF="../downloads.html">
download links</A> web page or better yet read the installation instructions
for <A HREF="expgui_Win_readme.html">
Windows</A>,
<A HREF="expgui_Unix_readme.html">
UNIX</A>, or 
<A HREF="osx.html">
Mac OS X</A>.
</blockquote>

<p><br><B>Who is to blame for EXPGUI?</B>
<blockquote>The initial version of the GUI part of EXPGUI was created by
Jonathan Wasserman (thanks Jon!) Brian
Toby</a> is irresponsible for the rest.</blockquote>

<p><br><B>EXPGUI would be much more of use to me if....</B>
<blockquote>Gee, you want to add some features... Great! You have all the
EXPGUI sources and
Tcl/Tk is free. Oh, you want me to do it. Well, please 
ask and I will try. In particular, I am looking for good ideas on 
how to design GUI's for different aspects of experiment editing, 
with an attractive, intuitive and compact layout.</blockquote>
