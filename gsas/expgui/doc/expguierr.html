This page contains additional information about various warning 
and error screens that may occur in EXPGUI as well as descriptions
for a number of utility functions.

<H2>Informational Messages</H2>
<a name="Overwrite"></a>
<h3>File has been modified...</h3> 
<DL><DL>
This message occurs when EXPGUI detects that the experiment file has 
been changed by another program. (EXPGUI only tracks the file 
modification date, so that the file could have been opened for writing,
but no actual changes were made.) This can be normal behavior -- for example
after a refinement cycle has been run, 
or this can signal a problem, such as two people 
or sessions trying to edit the same .EXP file.
This warning is made because a choice must be made: to keep the version
currently displayed in EXPGUI, or to use the new version
written by the other program. 
On UNIX, this message can be avoided by setting the 
<a href="expguic.html#Autoupdate">Autoupdate EXP</a> flag
to "on" causes .EXP files to be loaded automatically after GSAS
programs are run, eliminating most occurrences where this message is
displayed, but with the disadvantage that a bad refinement run can not
be reversed easily.
<UL>
<LI>
If you choose to keep the 
currently displayed version and make changes and then save the file, either
by using the File/Save menu option or by running a GSAS program,
the new version just written will be lost, 
if any changes are made in EXPGUI and are then saved. 
This can be useful -- to discard the
results of a refinement that has gone awry -- 
but in other cases may not be desirable.
<LI>
If you opt to load the new .EXP file, by pressing "Load new", 
the version currently displayed in 
the EXPGUI window will be lost. This is normally what you will want to do, 
but if you unsure, you can select "Continue with old", use File/Save As to 
save the version in EXPGUI and then use "EXPNAM" to load the new version, 
so they can be compared.
</UL>
If changes have been made to the experiment file in EXPGUI 
since it was last saved, and 
the file is changed by an external program, the message "you have made 
changes to this version" is added and a third button, 
"Save edited version", is shown. Under this circumstance, the usual action,
pressing "Load new" could result in valuable changes being lost. Pressing 
"Save edited version" results brings you to the File/"Save as" menu, 
where the modified version of the experiment file in EXPGUI can be 
saved under a new name.

<a name="lock"></a>
<h3>Please wait while GSAS program finishes...</h3> 
<DL><DL>
A window labeled "<font face="courier">Please wait while GSAS program finishes." 
If a problem occurs, close the DOS box and press the "Continue" button</font> 
is created in Windows-9x while GSAS programs are run. As this window 
is created, a "lock" file (<font face="courier">expgui.lck</font>) is also created. When the 
DOS batch file running the GSAS program completes, this file is deleted.
The EXPGUI process waits until the <font face="courier">expgui.lck</font> lock file 
is deleted. Should the DOS process crash before the file is deleted, 
the "Continue" button can be pressed. This causes 
EXPGUI to continue and deletes the lock file.

</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="Inputtitle"></a>
<h3>Input a value for the title</h3> 
<DL><DL>
A dialog with "Enter a value for the title for experiment..."  appears
when a new experiment is created. Note that this title can be edited 
later on the 
<a href="expgui1.html">Least Squares Control Page</a>.
</DL></DL>



<br clear=all>
<a name="ChooseCIF"></a>
<h3>Choose CIF Block</h3> 
<DL><DL>
When coordinates/cell parameters are read from a CIF, all blocks in the file
are read. If more than block containing coordinates is found, a message
saying "More than one block in CIF contains coordinates. Select the block to use."
One must then select one of these blocks from the list of blocks. 
The blocks with coordinates are listed, both numbered and with the 
block (data_) name. The "CIF Browser"
button can be pressed to view the data names and their values for each block.
</DL></DL>


<br clear=all>
<a name="open"></a>
<h3>Open Experiment File</h3> 
<DL><DL>
The Open Experiment windows is displayed to select a
experiment file to read or write, as well as a 
directory to use. When the message at the top reads 
"Select an experiment file to read" either an
existing experiment file should be selected, or a new
name may be typed in at the box at the bottom to enter
a name manually. If the file is not found, 
you will be warned and given the option of 
creating a new experiment with that name.

When the message at the top reads 
"Select an experiment file to create",
typically after a "Save as" command, 
the directory may be changed, but typically 
a file name will be typed into the bottom box.
If the file exists, you will be warned before the
file is overwritten and you will have the option 
to enter a different file name.
<P>
Note that the files in the list can be sorted 
alphabetically or can be sorted by the date the
experiment file was last modified, according to 
the checkbuttons to the upper right.
<P>
The "Include Archived Files" checkbox allows archive files
named <xxxxxx>.Onn to be read
(see the 
<A href="expguic.html#archive">archive option</A>).
See the <A href="#LoadArchived">Load Archived File</A>, below, for 
further discussion.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="LoadArchived"></a>
<h3>Load Archived File</h3> 
<DL><DL>
When a archived experiment file is read, the "Load Archived File" 
window is displayed to select the name to be used for the experiment.
There are two choices. One is to reuse existing name. 
This will cause the current version of the experiment file to be
archived so that it is not lost. The selected [older] archived
version will then be read and will be saved as the latest version of the
experiment file.
The other option is to save the experiment 
under a new name. 
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="ExcludeRegion"></a>
<h3>Exclude Data...<BR>Delete Region...</h3> 
<DL><DL>
This message is shown before adding or deleting an excluded region using
<a href="excledt.html">EXCLEDT</a> to confirm an action. 
See the <a href="excledt.html#AddRegion">discussion on Adding Regions</a>
in EXCLEDT.
Note that this 
confirmation message can be eliminated if desired, (see the
EXCLEDT Options menu item <a href="excledt.html#prompt">Prompt on add/del</a>.)
<br clear=all>
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="ProcessRegions"></a>
<h3>The upper (lower) limit has changed...<BR>The excluded regions have changed...</h3>
<DL><DL>
This message is shown 
if the upper data limit is raised (or d-min ls lowered) so that 
<a href="excledt.html">EXCLEDT</a> can display the data that have been added. 
It is also shown when 
<a href="excledt.html">EXCLEDT</a> exits so that the new data limits
can be processed. GENLES will not run properly until POWPREF is run.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="RegionTooBig"></a>
<h3>The upper (lower) data point...</h3>
<DL><DL>
This message is shown when the upper data limit (lower d-min limit)
well outside the range of data. 
It is probably best to accept this suggestion. See the 
<a href="excledt.html#LimitTooHigh">discussion on data limits</a>
in the EXCLEDT web page for more information.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="ProcessUse"></a>
<h3>You have changed histogram flags...</h3>
<DL><DL>
This message is shown 
after changing histogram flags so that a different set of histograms
will be included or excluded in a refinement.
GENLES will not run properly until POWPREF is run.
</DL></DL>

<a name="Warn"></a>
<H2>Warning Messages</H2>

<br clear=all>
<a name="AbandonEditConstraints"></a>
<a name="AbandonAtomConstraints"></a>
<h3>Abandoning Constraint Editing</h3> 
<DL><DL>
If the "Cancel Changes" button is pressed when
a profile or atom constraint is being edited or created, a message saying 
"Do you want to lose any changes made to this constraint?" is displayed, even
if no changes have been made to the constraint. Changes are recorded only when the
"Save" button is pressed.
</DL></DL>


<br clear=all>
<a name="OpenErr"></a>
<h3>File ... does not exist in ...</h3> 
<DL><DL>
When an attempt is made to open a file that does not
already exists, for example when the EXPNAM command
is used, this warning is displayed. The answer can be 
"Select other" or "Create", where "Select other" will
return you to a file selection dialog and "Create" 
will create a new dialog with this name.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="OverwriteErr"></a>
<a name="OverwriteCnv"></a>
<h3>File ... already exists in ... OK to overwrite?</h3> 
<DL><DL>
When an attempt is made to using the File/"Save As" 
command to write the current experiment file 
with a new name, but 
a file with the newly specified name already exists,
this message is displayed. Choose "Select other"
to specify a different file name or "Overwrite"
to use this name in which case the older file 
is replaced.
<P>
A similar warning will occur in UNIX when converting files.
If the intended output file already exists,
this message is displayed. Choose "Cancel"
to specify a different file name or "Overwrite"
to use this name in which case the older file 
is replaced. 
This message can be seen in Windows when converting files, 
for slightly different reasons. When files are converted, the 
converted file keeps the same name as the original version. However,
th original file is renamed to XXXX.ord, where XXXX.YYY is the 
original file name. If a file named XXXX.ord already exists, this message
is displayed.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="NoValidHist"></a>
<h3>No histograms are ready to plot. Run GENLES and try again.</h3> 
<DL><DL>
This happens when LIVEPLOT is run but no valid histograms are available 
to plot. LIVEPLOT can plot histograms only when they have been processed by 
both POWPREF and GENLES.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="Customizewarning"></a>
<h3>Error reading localconfig or .gsas_config:</h3> 
<DL><DL>
This happens when an invalid command is encountered in files 
<FONT FACE="COURIER">localconfig</FONT>, 
<FONT FACE="COURIER">~/.gsas_config</FONT>
or
<FONT FACE="COURIER">c:\gsas.config</FONT>. 
Some or all of the commands in these files 
will be skipped over, 
but nothing serious wrong will likely result. Note that the 
<FONT FACE="COURIER">localconfig</FONT> 
file is located in the expgui directory 
(typically 
<FONT FACE="COURIER">/home/gsas/expgui/localconfig</FONT> or
<FONT FACE="COURIER">C:\gsas\expgui\localconfig</FONT>) 
and the <FONT FACE="COURIER">.gsas_config</FONT>
or <FONT FACE="COURIER">gsas.config</FONT> file
is located in your home directory in UNIX or 
<FONT FACE="COURIER">c:\</FONT> in Windows.
If you rename or move these files, the error should go away. 
At that point you can decide if you want to track the error down to retain 
your <a href="expgui_cfg.html">customizations</a>. 
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="RunPowpref"></a>
<h3>You are attempting to run GENLES...:</h3> 
<DL><DL>
The POWPREF program maps reflections to every data point. If you 
add/remove phases or histograms, or change the diffractometer constants, 
cell parameters, profile parameters, and so on, you need to run POWPREF
before running GENLES. If EXPGUI catches you forgetting to do this, it
reminds you. However, not all possible changes that would require POWPREF are 
caught.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="BadLaue"></a>
<h3>Error processing Laue code:</h3> 
<DL><DL>
The message "Error processing Laue code: XXXX
Error in space group YYYY..." occurs when the Laue class for a space group
could not be determined when editing unit cell constants. This is likely
due to you entering an invalid space group or else a bug in EXPGUI in 
parsing the output from program SPACEGROUP. The former is more likely,
but if you encounter a bug, please send it in</A>, be sure
to specify how where spaces were used in the string (e.g. "P 21 21 21" vs. 
"P21 21 21").

<h3>Unable to find file GRFONT.DAT...</h3> 
<DL><DL>
The file <font face="courier">grfont.dat</font> is expected to be in the ...\gsas\fonts directory
in DOS/Windows platforms and files <font face="courier">grfont.dat</font> and 
<font face="courier">pgxwin_server</font> are expected to be found in the .../gsas/pgl directory
in UNIX. If these files cannot be found, GSAS will not be able to produce 
graphics in programs such as POWPLOT, RAWPLOT,...
If GSAS and EXPGUI are correctly installed this error will not occur
(see the installation notes for 
<A HREF="expgui_Win_readme.html">Windows</A>
and 
<A HREF="expgui_Unix_readme.html">UNIX</A>.

</DL></DL>

<a name="ConvSameName"></a>
<h3>Sorry, filenames must differ</h3> 
<DL><DL>
For UNIX file conversions, the input and output file names
must be different. You have specified the same name twice.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="NoRename"></a>
<h3>Unable to rename <I>XXXXX</I>.LST</h3> 
<DL><DL>
This message is displayed if the GSAS .LST file could not 
be renamed prior to running DISAGL in a separate window. 
On Windows it appears that LSTVIEW can prevent EXPGUI
from renaming the .LST file. Either exit LSTVIEW
while running DISAGL or reset the DISAGL option
DISAGL so that output goes to the .LST file.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="OldEXPTOOL"></a>
<h3>You must upgrade the EXPTOOL program...</h3> 
<DL><DL>
The original version of the EXPTOOL program used within 
EXPGUI to add histograms does not work with dummy histograms.
Versions of GSAS distributed prior to October 2001 do not contain this updated
routine. A more recent version of the EXPTOOL program can
be downloaded from 
<A Href="ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/exe_win/">
ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/exe_win/</A>,
<A Href="ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/exe_linux/">
ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/exe_linux/</A> or
<A Href="ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/exe_sgi/">
ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/exe_sgi/</A>.
Alternately, EXPEDT can be used to add dummy histograms.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="TCLDUMPError"></a>
<h3>Error running TCLDUMP (LIVEPLOT or BKGEDIT)</h3> 
<DL><DL>
The program TCLDUMP (or program HSTDMP if TCLDUMP is not found) is used to read
the binary <I>expnam</I>.Pxx and <I>expnam</I>.Rxx files produced by 
POWPREF and GENLES so that refinement results can be plotted.
If there is an error reading these files, an error message is produced
reading "There was an error running the TCLDUMP program..." 
and the text of the error message reads something like 
"Invalid command name 'FORTRAN'".
The most common reason for this error is that the 
<I>expnam</I>.Pxx and <I>expnam</I>.Rxx files do not exist (because you have
not run POWPREF or have moved/renamed the .EXP file. It is possible, 
but less common for this error to occur if TCLDUMP tries to read files
produced by an older version of GSAS (since the internal format of the 
binary files sometimes changes). If you see this message, run POWPREF & GENLES
to force these files to be written. If the GSAS results can be plotted in
POWPLOT, but not in LIVEPLOT or BKGEDIT, please contact Brian Toby at
<a href="mailto:brian.toby@anl.gov">Brian.Toby@ANL.GOV</a>.
