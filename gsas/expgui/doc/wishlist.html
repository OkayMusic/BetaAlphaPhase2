<H2>RECENT ADDITIONS TO EXPGUI</H2><DL>
Additional features & fixes added to EXPGUI since mid-2000 are listed here,
with an approximate date the features were added and the EXPGUI version
where the feature was added. This list includes only the more significant 
changes.
For a complete list of all changes for the source files
see <A HREF="revlog.html">the EXPGUI Revision log.</A>
<P>
<DT>Import pdCIF data 
<DD>EXPGUI can now read powder CIF data and rewrite it as
  GSAS .fxye (1 line per file) data. For CW data only. 
(4/2006, 1.83)
<DT>DISAGL export
<DD>Add button to select distances from 1 phase and copy to Windows clipboard
  to interface with Andrew Will's VaList program (not yet tested).
(4/2006, 1.83)
<DT>Bug fixes & cleanup
<DD>Bugs in EXCLEDT, Import Atoms, etc; relabel many buttons for better
  consistency and to be more conventional.
(4/2006, 1.83)
<DT>EXPGUI macros added
<DD>EXPGUI can record nearly all actions into a macro file. The macro file
  can be "replayed" to repeat those actions on a new experiment. Macro
  files can replayed a line at a time or can be executed all at once.
  Tcl commands
  can be introduced into a macro file so that programming can be done
  with macro files. Misc changes to suit this such as turn of prompt when
  running GSAS programs; run GSAS programs w/o terminal windows.
(4/2006, 1.82)
<DT>User error checking
<DD>Check for final R in space group name for R space groups in
  rhombohedral settings.
(4/2006, 1.82)
<DT>Lattice parameter entry
<DD>Unit cell type now constrains the number of lattice parameters that can be
  entered.
(4/2006, 1.82)
<DT>Import diffractometer constants
<DD>Diffractometer constants can be read from a GSAS .EXP file into INSTEDIT.
(4/2006, 1.82)
<DT>Minor changes
<DD>fix grace export, spelling on convergence, warn on windows if COMSPEC
  (cmd.exe location) is not defined.
(4/2006, 1.81)
<DT>Minor changes
<DD>Add gsas2map, remove now defunct background #3, fix Q conversion in background
(4/2006, 1.80)

<DT>TOF facilities
<DD>Improve adding multiple histograms by specifying d-min or Q-max in place 
of tof-min; Allow INSTEDIT to be used for TOF instrument parameter files.
(4/2006, 1.79)
<DT>MUSTRPLOT
<DD>Add micro-strain plotting program to menus.
(4/2006, 1.79)

<DT>Recomputation of Multiplicities
<DD>EXPGUI can now recompute the multiplicities for a set of atoms. This can be 
done with a button on the edit atoms page and is automatically done when the 
atoms coordinates are changed with a transformation matrix or an origin shift
as well as prior to a composition computation.
(2/2006, 1.78)
<DT>Bug & Cosmetic Fixes
<DD>Put GSAS into window title
<BR>rationalize appearance of some labels fields (histogram heading & history)
<BR>bug: in global setting of phase fractions & ph. frac. damping
<BR>prevent use of more than 36 bkg parameters in BKGFIT, since that is all GSAS allows
<BR>fix bug in 2theta max when adding multiple histograms
(2/2006, 1.78)

<DT>
Transform Atoms - Origin 1 -> 2
<DD>
The option to transform Origin 1 settings to Origin 2 is now provided 
in the windows raised by th "xform atom(s)" button on the phase panel.
(9/2005, 1.77)

<DT>
DRAWxtl Export
<DD>
DRAWxtl export has been enhanced to display vectors for magnetic phases
and to launch DRAWxtl directly.
(9/2005, 1.77)

<DT>Spherical Harmonic Fix
<DD>In June 2005, GSAS was changed to allow more spherical harmonic terms
by renaming the CRSxODF records. EXPGUI now converts old records to the 
new format and can read them.
(9/2005, 1.77)

<DT>Import coordinates from .EXP file
<DD>Fix bug introduced when new all-in-one Tcl/Tk package was implemented 
(missing package require Tk).
(9/2005, 1.77)

<DT>Print from LSTVIEW (Unix only)
<DD>Selected text can be sent to lpr command
(3/2005, 1.76)

<DT>Misc fixes from RBVD
<DD>Fix profile 4 labels, add support for #5, add LS Band control, add
extra digit to PRNT for extra option, note Pawley phase.
(3/2005, 1.76)

<DT>Prevent use of Zero & SHFT (+ TRANS) parameters together
<DD>A common GSAS error is to refine a zero correction together with 
the Bragg-Brentano corrections (SHFT & TRANS). When Zero is refined, 
TRANS & SHFT are now turned off and disabled.
(3/2005, 1.76)


<DT>Cleanup/Bug fixes
<DD>Require BWidget package; provide a clear error message when not found.
Fix vector access in liveplot (not broken?) & excledt for BLT2.4z.
More documentation changes.
(9/2004, 1.75)
<DT>Installation/instructions
<DD>New GSAS/EXPGUI packages have been created for 
all platforms using the new Tcl/Tk starkits. 
The installation instructions for Windows, SGI/Linux & Mac OS X have
been extensively revised.
(9/2004, 1.74)
<DT>WINUTILS
<DD>EXPGUI now can use the WINUTILS or WINEXEC package to run 
GSAS programs in a COMMAND.COM window on Windows-95/-98 and -ME. 
This was needed to update to a newer Tcl/Tk release that fixes
a hang in -XP. Note that WINUTILS & WINEXEC are not used
in -NT/-2000/-XP.
Also, misc "package require" etc. to use Tcl/Tk Starkit (all platforms).
(9/2004, 1.74)
<DT>Coordinate export to DRAWXTL
<DD>new export routine creates a .STR file for the
very nice 
<A HREF="http://www.lwfinger.net/drawxtl/">DRAWXTL</A> visualization program. 
(9/2004, 1.74)
<DT>Coordinate export to CIF
<DD>new export routine creates a bare-bones CIF file with coordinates
for a phase.
(9/2004, 1.73)
<DT>Fix non-ASCII character bug
<DD>A bug was fixed that previously allowed EXPGUI to place 
non-ASCII characters into a .EXP file. GSAS could not read these files. 
This may not address every possible way this could happen (I was bit 
by this before, see note on v1.64), but should catch a lot more of these
problems.
(9/2004, 1.73)

<DT>zoom fixes for BLT2.4z
<DD>BLT 2.4z changes, yet again the binding for zooming; EXCLEDT & BKGEDIT 
were updated to address this. The best cure for this is probably to not
use the mouse buttons for other purposes.
(5/2004, 1.72)
<DT>LIVEPLOT ignore bad element attributes
<DD>if a bad color value, etc. was saved for liveplot, the program would 
not start; this has been fixed.
(5/2004, 1.72)
<DT>Open Console
<DD>An "open console" command has been added to the help menu in EXPGUI, 
LSTVIEW, LIVEPLOT, BKGFIT, WIDPLT & ABSPLT to help with debugging
(5/2004, 1.72)

<DT>Misc bug fixes (from Lachlan)
<DD>make sure initial alpha1:2 ratio is 0.5 not 0.0; fix INSTEDIT none button; 
save changes before BKGEDIT.
(5/2004, 1.71)
<DT>LIVEPLOT
<DD>Add (obs-calc)/sigma plotting to LIVEPLOT 
<BR>Use arrow keys to move zoom region around (convenient!)
(4/2004, 1.71)
<DT>Fox export
<DD>Flag origin 2 space groups for FOX XML output
(4/2004, 1.71)
<DT>INSTEDIT bug
<DD>Add ITYP line to instrument parameter file
(4/2004, 1.71)
<DT>Scan plot zoom
<DD>The zoom region in LIVEPLOT, EXCLEDT & BKGEDIT can be moved around 
with the arrow keys (convenient!)
(4/2004, 1.71)

<DT>Customization for OS X
<DD>On OS X, EXPGUI will set app & define icon for .EXP files
(1/2004, 1.69)

<DT>CIF updates
<DD>Update CIF codes to use different indexing scheme for dictionaries
(12/2003, 1.68)

<DT>reflection mark bug in excledt
<DD>Fix edit broken close button for edit reflection marks in excledt; remove
unneeded phases from option list; implement reflection mark shortcuts [press 
1 for phase 1,...]
(12/2003, 1.65)

<DT>Fix "Chinese date bug"
<DD>Windows computers set to operate with Chinese inserted timezone reference
into .EXP history record with chinese characters; this made .EXP file invalid
within GSAS. The time zone is no longer recorded.
(11/2003, 1.64)

<DT>Change "Use new name" for archived .EXP files
<DD>If you are reloading an archived .EXP file, you can copy it to be the 
latest version of the current .EXP file, or supply a new name. Previously, 
it saved the current file under a new name -- what was I thinking then?
(11/2003, 1.64)

<DT>OS X compatible
<DD>This version of EXPGUI runs under Macintosh OS X(!)
(11/2003, 1.64)

<DT>Add Multiple Histograms
<DD>This option allows two or more "banks" of data to be read in a single 
pass for use with multibank diffractometers
(8/2003, 1.62)

<P>
<DT>Instrument parameter file editor
<DD>This is used to modify and create instrument parameter files
(5/2003, 1.61)

<DT>Absorption correction big fix.
<DD>The problem where a change made by EXPGUI causes EXPEDT to garble 
the ABSCOR record has been located and fixed, finally. Thanks are due to 
detailed bug reports from 3 different people, so that this bug could be 
tracked down!
(5/2003, 1.61)


<DT>Change .gsas_config to c:\gsas.config on windows
<DD>The name ~/.gsas_config makes sense in UNIX but is clumsy in Windows
(5/2003, 1.61)

<DT>LIVEPLOT export
<DD>Liveplot now exports data to FOX and .CSV files (to produce publication
quality graphics).
(4/2003, 1.60)

<DT>Export to FOX
<DD>EXPGUI can now export coordinates & raw data to FOX 
(Free Objects for Xtallography, objcryst.sourceforge.net)
via XML.
(9/2002, 1.58) & 
(4/2003, 1.60)

<DT>TOF bug fixes, POWPREF nagging
<DD>The "add histogram", EXCLEDT and BKGEDIT sections were reworked to 
correct errors in handling TOF datasets. EXPGUI flags changes that 
would require POWPREF to be run before GENLES and warns if POWPREF is not
run.
(4/2003, 1.60)

<DT>GSAS2CIF, FillCIF & CIFSelect
<DD>The GSAS2CIF program has been rewritten, the FillCIF utility
has been created to edit the new CIF templates
and the new CIFSelect utility is provided to edit distance & angle publication
flags. A new <a href="gsas2cif.html">GSAS2CIF web page</A> has been created to describe the process.
(9/2002, 1.58)


<DT>Fix profile constraint bug
<DD>Profile constraints now must have a histogram & phase selected; 
defaults are used, where appropriate.
(9/2002, 1.58)

<DD>Fix bugs: reading of spacegroup in CIFs, large .LST files in LSTVIEW
(2/2002, 1.55)

<DT>Absorption/Reflection Correction
<DD>A new box has been added to the histogram panel to control
the absorption parameters.
(1/2002, 1.55)

<DT>Coordinate Import/Export

<BR>
Optionally Label tickmarks by phase name & edit phase label on
the edit tickmarks menu.
<BR>
Plots can now be exported to GRACE (aka xmgr) to 
produce publication-quality graphics. A similar
feature for a Windows program, 
preferably a common and not overly expensive (at least for academic users),
if one can be found that accepts ASCII command files.
(1/2002, 1.54)

<DT>LSTVIEW enhancements<DD>
LSTVIEW can now be used to plot R-factors as a function of the
cycle number. If the summary of shifts output option is on, 
the ratio of shifts to standard uncertainty can also be plotted.

A .EXP or .Oxx file is selected (as well as a phase, 
if more than one is present) and the coordinates are imported into
the current experiment file. 
(10/2001, 1.48)

<DT>Web help<DD>

(9/2001, 1.46)

<DT>
Add Marquardt damping, LeBail damping to GUI
<DD>
These parameters are on "LS Controls" panel, along with

<DD>
When an invalid entry is specified, (for example 1..0 is typed, instead
of 1.0) EXPGUI ignores the entry and (now) it is also displayed in red, to 
flag the error. This only happens for entries on the main panels. For
entries on modal dialogs (where there a "done" or "keep" button), these
errors will be reported only when the button is pressed. (10/2000, 1.38)

Import Atoms/Import Phase
<DD>
A CIF import routine is now available. (10/2000, 1.38)

<DT>
"Non-shell" version of EXPGUI
<DD>
EXPGUI has two functions, 1) to act as a "shell" that calls the 
various GSAS programs, and 2) to edit the .EXP file. For use with 
MacGSAS (and possibly the standard Win-95 GSAS shell), it is possible
to turn off the "shell" features -- by calling EXPGUI with the argument
-noshell or /noshell or by setting environment variable EXPGUI_NOSHELL to 1.
This mode has not yet been tested and is not expected to 
be needed due to the OS X release. (10/2000, 1.36)

<DT>
NIST accessibility requirement
<DD>
NIST requires that all images in WWW pages have an ALT= tag included.
This has been done on all the documentation HTML pages, despite the 
fact that (in this case) it adds no new content for anyone.

<DT>
Change space group/Import from file
<DD>
A mechanism where one can specify a new space group, cell,
and reinput all atoms for the phase (to get site syms correct). One can
keep the old atoms for the phase or replace them. It is possible
to do this manually or with a file import capability.
At present the only file type accepted is 
the .CEL format from PowderCell. New format filters can be "dropped" in
place. (8/2000, 1.33)

<DT>
Import Atoms/Import Phase
<DD>
This appears on the add atoms & add phase dialogs and draws on the above. 
(8/2000, 1.33)

<DT>
Transform Atoms
<DD>
There is now a "xform atom(s)" button on the phase panel that 
can be used to transform coordinates,
globally set the occupancy & Uiso and switch atoms between
iso/aniso and erase selected groups of atoms
(8/2000, 1.31)

<DT>
Delete phases
<DD>
Work around -- change phase flags on the histogram page (appears when 2+ phases
present). 
(8/2000, 1.31)

<DT>
Spherical Harmonic (ODF) Preferred Orientation
<DD>
done 
(7/2000, 1.29)

<DT>
Define background types
<DD>
The pull-down background selection menu now shows the names of the 
background functions (7/2000, 1.29)
