<H3>C.1 File Menu</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The options on the File menu as is the custom contains the commands 
for reading and writing experiment files, as well as starting 
and ending the program.
<DL>
<DT>Open<DD>
    	Select an existing GSAS experiment to be used. If a name is entered 
	that does not exists, it is possible to create a new
	experiment file from scratch.
<DT>expnam<DD>
Equivalent to Open (included for historical reasons.)

<DT>Save<DD>Saves modifications to the current experiment file to disk (shortcut Alt-S).
<DT>Save As<DD>Saves modifications to the current experiment file to disk
	under a new file name
<DT>Reread .EXP file<DD>Reread the last saved version of the
  experiment file from disk.
<DT>Update GSAS/EXPGUI<DD>This queries the EXPGUI software repository
  to see if any files in EXPGUI or GSAS has been updated. It then
  offers the program user the option to update these files. The update
  will fail if the user does not have permission to change the EXPGUI
  or GSAS files. In this case, a system administrator may be needed.
  <DT>revert<DD>Used to load an <a href="#archive">archived</A>
    (backup) version of the current .EXP file. 
<DT>EraseHistory<DD>Deletes old history records to speed reading of the .EXP file.
<DT>convert<DD>Convert a standard ASCII file to the direct access
  format used by GSAS (and for UNIX, the reverse) -- this is not
  likely to be needed, as GSAS now does most conversions automatically.
<DT>exit<DD>Exit EXPGUI (shortcut Alt-X or ^C)
</DL>

<h3>C.2 Options Menu</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This menu contains options that determine how EXPGUI runs.
<a name="archive"></a>
<DL>
<DT>archive EXP<DD>
  Toggles archiving of .EXP files. When on, files are 
	saved before they are overwritten by EXPGUI as a file
	named <I>EXPNAM</I>.Oxx where xx is a pair of hexidecimal
	digits (01, 02,..., 09, 0A,... OF, 10,... FF). 
	Each time that EXPGUI archives a file, note is placed in the .LST file
	so that the saved file name can be associated with 
	the refinement stage. Turning this option off, prevents EXPGUI
	from creating these <I>EXPNAM</I>.Oxx archive files, but 
	the will still be created by EXPEDT, GENLES,...
<P>
<DT>Use DISAGL Window<DD>When this option is set, results from DISAGL are 
         shown in a separate window. When it is not set, the results are
        written in the .LST file. Note that on Windows, LSTVIEW can interfere
	with putting output into the DISAGL window. The solution is to 
	close LSTVIEW before running DISAGL.

<a name="Autoupdate"></a>
<DT>Autoload EXP<DD>Normally EXPGUI prompts before rereading the EXP 
file when GENLES, POWPREF,... or other GSAS programs run 
If this option is set, the new file is automatically read without a prompt. 
The advantage of leaving this option off, is that 
you can opt to not load the
revised .EXP file, which means that you reject the last set of changes.
This is useful if 
GENLES blows up or you have done something wrong. The reason to  
turning "autoload EXP" on is
that there is one less thing to do when running GSAS programs.
Note that it is still possible to reverse changes, if 
<a href="#archive">archive files</A>, but this may require more
  effort. See the File/revert menu entry.
<a name="execprompt"></a>
<DT>Prompt after GSAS run<DD>
<IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=36 alt="New!">
By default, GSAS programs are run in a separate window 
and after the program completes, the window remains open until enter is
pressed in the window. Turning the "Prompt after GSAS run" option off, causes
the window to be closed immediately after the program completes, saving 
some effort but obliterating any error messages or other evidence of problems.

<a name="Autoicon"></a>
<DT>Iconify during GSAS<DD>
If this option is turned on, the main EXPGUI window is shrunk to an icon
(minimized) while GSAS programs are running and EXPGUI is suspended. 
The author prefers this mode, since there is no reason to have the 
screen cluttered with EXPGUI when it can't be used, 
but this is an option so that the mode can be turned off by those people
who find this behavior annoying. It appears this option causes
  problems on Windows 7. 

<a name="AutostartGRWND"></a>
<DT>Autostart GRWND
<DD>
This option is available on Windows-95, -98 and -ME to deal with a operating
system quirk that prevents the starting of the GRWND.EXE program, 
needed for graphics in GSAS programs such as POWPLOT, RAWPLOT, EXPEDT,...
(this program is not needed for EXPGUI graphics, such as LIVEPLOT). It 
is not understood why this error happens or how to prevent it. One cure
is to start this GRWND.EXE program before starting the GSAS program. 
If this option is selected, each time a GSAS program is started, a separate
program TLIST.EXE is used to check if GRWND.EXE is running. If it is not, 
EXPGUI will start this program before starting the requested GSAS program.

<a name="sortatoms"></a>
<DT>Sort atoms by<DD>	Determines the order that atoms are displayed on the "Phase" pane
	Atoms may be displayed sorted by number, atom type, site multiplity,
	occupancy, or by x, y or z coordinate
<P>
Clicking on the heading above the atoms list cycles with the left
mouse button cycles through the atom sort modes. Clicking with
the right mouse button resets the atom sort mode to "number".

<a name="sorthist"></a>
<DT>Sort histograms by<DD>Determines the order that histograms are displayed on the 
	Histogram, Scaling and Profile panes

	Histograms may be sorted by histogram number, histogram type, 
	original bank number, or diffraction angle/wavelength
<DT><A href="expgui.html#multiplehistogram">Multiple hist. selection</A><DD>
        When this mode is off, it is possible to modify parameters
	and refinement flags for only a single histogram. For other settings,
	it is possible to modify parameters and flags for groups of 
	histograms (see help for Mouse actions). 

	It does not make sense, however, to globally modify
	instrument-related parameters and flags for different histogram types.
	So global actions can be limited to a single class of histogram types
	(e.g. TOF, CW Neutron,...), which allows these parameters to be set
	for groups of similar histograms. Thus, if this mode is set to "All"
	the Histogram and Profile panes are disabled.
<DT>Override backspace<DD>This option is available in UNIX only, as there are different
	ways that backspace can be implemented. When option is set 
	as "On," the backspace key is overridden to send a "delete" 
	character. If backspace does not work in a program such as 
	EXPEDT, change try the other setting for this option.

<a name="setfont"></a>
<DT>Set Screen Font
<DD>
This menu changes the fonts used in most sections of EXPGUI. 
Note that this setting can be saved with the 
SaveOptions menu option (below) so that EXPGUI automatically
starts with the chosen font.

<a name="exptoolout"></a>
<DT>Show EXPTOOL output<DD>
Normally EXPGUI does not show the output from EXPTOOL, when 
actions like adding atoms, phases or histograms is performed.
If an error is detected, the output is shown. If 
there are problems with adding phases, atoms, histograms... and
a window showing an error does not appear,
this option should be set to "on" so the output from EXPTOOL is 
always shown.

<DT>Save Options<DD>Save the current values for "Override backspace", 
	<a href="#sortatoms">"Sort atoms by"</a>,

<DT>Save Position<DD>Saves the current screen position of the EXPGUI
  window as the starting point for future runs of EXPGUI in
  	in file ~/.gsas_config (or c:\gsas.config on Windows).

<DT>liveplot_options<DD>Used to set options for 
<a HREF="liveplot.html#liveplot">LIVEPLOT</a>,

<DT>Assign app to .EXP files<DD>(on Mac only) When selected, this
  causes .EXP files to be linked (via the file resource fork) to the
  EXPGUI applescript. This also causes the .EXP files to be displayed
  with a GSAS icon.

<h3>C.8 Macro Menu
<IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=36 alt="New!">
</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The macro capability allows actions performed in EXPGUI to be captured into a
file as a series of Tcl command.
It is then possible to repeat the actions in a macro repeatedly 
by replaying the macro. Note that macro files can be edited and 
Tcl/Tk commands can be added to the macros to expand capabilities. 
As an example, this code
<blockquote><TT><PRE>
runAddHist Data.raw 11BM-12D.INS 1 1 T 59.9995
runAddHist Data.raw 11BM-12D.INS 2 2 T 57.9995
runAddHist Data.raw 11BM-12D.INS 3 3 T 55.9995
runAddHist Data.raw 11BM-12D.INS 4 4 T 53.9995
</PRE></TT></blockquote>
can be modified to prompt for a file name and then use it in a macro:
<blockquote><TT><PRE>
set DataFile [tk_getOpenFile -defaultextension .raw]
runAddHist $DataFile 11BM-12D.INS 1 1 T 59.9995
runAddHist $DataFile 11BM-12D.INS 2 2 T 57.9995
runAddHist $DataFile 11BM-12D.INS 3 3 T 55.9995
runAddHist $DataFile 11BM-12D.INS 4 4 T 53.9995
</blockquote></TT></DL>
<DL>
<DT>Record EXPGUI macro<DD>
When this option is turned on, subsequent actions are recorded into the 
selected macro file. 
<DT>Add comment to macro<DD>
If this option is selected, a window is opened where a string can be typed.
This information is then entered at the current point within the macro file
as a comment. 
<DT>Replay macro line-at-a-time<DD>
When this option is used, a macro file is selected by the user; the 
contents of the macro file is displayed, and button can be pressed to execute 
each command in the macro file. By clicking on a line in a macro file, that line
will be the next to be run, so that sections of the file can be skipped over
or repeated. The macro can also be edited within the file viewer window.
<DT>Replay macro all at once<DD>
When this option is used, a macro file is selected by the user, and then
all commands in the macro file are executed. A status window is opened that 
shows the number of refinement cycles, Chi<sup>2</sup> and the last sum of 
shifts and also allows macros to be aborted. Note that any GSAS run in progress
will run to completion before the Abort is invoked.
Note that <A href="#Autoupdate">Autoload EXP</A> is temporarily set to 
on and <A href="#execprompt">Prompt after GSAS run</A>
is temporarily set to off, when this command is invoked, so that the macro 
runs without need for prompts.

<DT>Show GSAS output in window<DD>
When this option is selected, GSAS programs are run in a separate window
that is created for each program run -- even during macro execution. 
When this option is deselected, output from GSAS programs is placed in a 
separate file 
(<I>XXXXXXXX</I>_mac.LST where <I>XXXXXXXX</I> is the experiment name) 
and LSTVIEW is opened to view the output from that .LST file.
</DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<a name="8"></a>
<h3>C.9 Import/Export Menu</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This menu contains utilities for importing information into GSAS and
exporting it to other programs.
<DL>
<DT>Coord Export<DD>This provides a series of routines that are used
to write coordinates and possibly other information to files:<P>
<DL>
<DT>gsas2cif<DD>Prepares IUCr crystallographic information (CIF) file
that documents the current refinement. The CIF contains the
coordinates for all phases as well as the observed and computed
diffraction patterns. The templates used by GSAS2CIF can be customized
to provide a detailed description of the experimental measurements and
results for use in documenting analysis for publication or
deposition. 
<DT>coords-only CIF<DD>For export of intermediate results to another
program, CIF can be a useful exchange format. This routine provides a
CIF with the current coordinates from one phase and not much else.
<a name="DRAWxtl"></a>
<DT>export to DRAWxtl<DD>
  <A HREF="http://www.lwfinger.net/drawxtl/">DRAWxtl</A>
  is a very useful free program for display of structures and
maps. This writes a .STR input file used in the DRAWxtl
program and optionally launches DRAWxtl, if installed.
While the control options offered by EXPGUI are relatively
modest (display of polyhedra,
selection for bonds to be drawn, display of Fourier contours), 
once the DRAWxtl program is launched, the full range of DRAWxtl
options can be accessed from that program's GUI. When a Fourier map
contour is included, the Fourier parameters are set, the map is
computed (program fourier) and is converted to the format needed by
DRAWxtl (program gsas2map) automatically. 
<DT>export to SHELX<DD>This writes coordinates for a selected phase in
the .INS format used by SHELX and several other programs.
<DT>export to PLATON<DD>This writes coordinates for a selected phase in
the .SPF format used by PLATON
<DT>export test format<DD>This demonstrates how a coordinate export
routine can be added to EXPGUI. See the <A
HREF="expgui_cfg.html#export">documentation on this</A> for further
information. 
<DT>export to FOX<DD>This prepares a XML file with coordinates for use
in the FOX program
<DT>MSI .xtl<DD>Prepare a .XTL format file of atomic positions. This
file is used in older Accelrys software such as Cerius and
Insight-II. It may no longer be of value.
</DL>

<DT>CIF Export<DD>This provides a series of routines that are used
to prepare CIF files:<P>
<DL>
<DT>gsas2cif<DD>Prepares IUCr crystallographic information (CIF) file
that documents the current refinement. The CIF contains the
coordinates for all phases as well as the observed and computed
diffraction patterns. The templates used by GSAS2CIF can be customized
to provide a detailed description of the experimental measurements and
results for use in documenting analysis for publication or
deposition.
<DT>FillTemplate<DD>Used to edit the CIF template files used in GSAS2CIF
<DT>CIFselect<DD>Used to select interatomic distances and angles to be
included in the CIF created by GSAS2CIF.
</DL>

<DT>hklsort<DD>Prepare HKL tables
