EXPGUI is a graphical interface for the 
<A Href="https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/EXPGUI/wiki/GSASIntro">GSAS</A>
package, developed at Los Alamos and maintained now at Argonne. 
EXPGUI does two things: 
it can be used to directly modify the GSAS 
experiment file with a graphical user interface (GUI) and 
it can be used to invoke the programs inside the 
GSAS package such as EXPEDT, GENLES, FOURIER...
These programs can be run from a menu or in many cases by pressing buttons.
EXPGUI is written using the
<A href="#tcltk">Tcl/Tk</A> scripting language.

<h2>A. Experiment file editing</h2>
<P>
<DL><DL>
When an experiment (.EXP) file is read, a copy is made in local 
computer memory. In most cases, values are changed in this 
"in memory" copy of the experiment file 
as this information is changed by the user on the screen.
<img SRC="rederror.gif" align=LEFT BORDER=3 alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot">
<IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=36 alt="New!">
If there is an error in the typed value, (for example if "1..0" is typed, or
"1.5" is typed where an integer is expected), these values are 
not saved. In this case, the text is turned red, to indicate 
that an error is present, as shown in the figure to the left, where "90.000x" 
has been entered for alpha.
The edited version of the experiment file is written back out to 
disk when the "File/Save" or "File/Save as" 
<A Href="expguic.html#1">menu bar options</A>
are used. The File/Save operation is done automatically before any GSAS
programs, such as GENLES or EXPEDT, are run.
<P>
<A name="badexp">
The GSAS refinement program, GENLES, will sometimes "blow up", where the
  program changes varied parameters to values very far from their
  correct values. This occurs when parameters are highly correlated,
  are refining to values that are not allowed, or some of the refined parameters have
  very little impact on the quality of the fit. When this happens,
  invalid values are written to the GSAS experiment file that contain
  either asterisks (****) or the string "NAN" (not a number). Such
  files cannot be used for additional GENLES runs.
  <P>
  When EXPGUI reads a .EXP file it scans it for evidence of a previous
  failure of a GENLES refinement and warns if a problem is
  noted. Please note that this scan is not perfect and occasionally
  you may be warned in cases where the file is fine (if possible,
  please send such .EXP file to Brian Toby so this scan can be improved.)
  When such a "bad" .EXP file is located, one can "revert" to an
  archived copy of a previous experiment file (with suffix .Oxx). This
  can be done with the Revert menu item in the File menu. Note that
clicking on a file in the file selection window causes it to be
scanned and shows the status of that refinement. Also note that
usually the last good archived file has settings that will produce the same bad
refinement, so it is necessary to either revert further back, or to
change the refinement options before running GENLES. 
<P>

Since the GSAS experiment file is quite complex, 
values are grouped together by function, approximately
following the outline of the EXPEDT program. 
Each set of values is given a 
"tabbed panel" on a window that has the appearance of a notebook (see below).
<center><B>
<br>The notebook panel tabs.
<br><img SRC="panebar1.gif"  BORDER=3 alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot">
</center></B>
In some cases, where values are 
too numerous or complex to fit onto the notebook panel, one or more buttons
may be present on a panel that will create a separate window,
where the associated values can be modified. 
These values are not recorded in the 
"in memory" copy of the experiment file unless the "Save" button on this window
is pressed. If "Cancel" is pressed, no changes are made.
Each notebook panel is listed below with a link to the web page documenting 
that panel.

<h2>B. Shortcuts</h2></a>
<a name="multiplehistogram">
<h3>B.1 Multiple Histogram Selection</h3></a>
<DL><DL>
This mode allows parameters to be changed for groups of
histograms. 
When the "Multiple Histogram Selection" mode is off, 
it is possible to modify parameters
and refinement flags for only a single histogram, but
the other settings allow groups of histograms 
to be selected and modified.
<A href="#mouseactions">(see Mouse Actions)</A>.
<P>
It does not make sense, however, to globally modify
instrument-related parameters and flags for different 
histogram types.
So global actions can be limited to a single class 
of histogram types (e.g. TOF, CW Neutron,...), which 
allows these parameters to be set for groups of 
similar histograms. Thus, if this mode is set to "All"
the Histogram and Profile panels are disabled.
<P>
The setting for "Multiple Histogram Selection" mode is 
displayed above each histogram selection box and is
selected using the "Multiple Hist. Selection" item on the 
Options menu to create a submenu or by clicking on the display. 
Note that another option in this "Multiple Hist. Selection" 
submenu is an option "Group Phases Together" that controls how 
EXPGUI treats phases having
the same profile type that is used when multiple histograms are selected. If 
the "Group Phases Together" option is on, then the refinement flags for 
all phases with the same histogram types are grouped together, when possible.
If this option is off, phases are treated separately.
<IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=36 alt="New!">
If the left mouse button is used to click on the selection mode display,
the mode is cycled between the available modes. If the right mouse
button is used, the mode is reset, to disable multiple histogram selection.

<a name="mouseactions">
</DL></DL>
<h3>B.2 Mouse Actions</h3></a>
<DL><DL>
A range of atoms or (in multiple selection mode) histograms may be
selected by dragging (holding down) the left mouse button. It is also
possible to select a range by using the Shift key with the left mouse
button. To select or deselect individual entries, use the Control key
with the left mouse button. Pressing the right mouse button selects all
entries in a list.
</DL></DL>

<h2>C. Menu Commands and Programs</h2>
<p>
GSAS programs are invoked either through use of the menu bar
<center><B>
<br>The menu bar.
<br><img SRC="menubar.gif" BORDER=3 alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot">
</center></B>
or by "pressing" a button on the button bar. The button bar
simply provides an easy way to access commonly used 
actions on the menu bar. Users can 
<A HREF="expgui_cfg.html">
configure the menu bar</A> to include their own preferred actions and, with
some knowledge of the program and Tcl/Tk,
add their own commands to the menu bar or button bar.

<center><B>
<br>The button bar.
<br><img SRC="buttonbar.gif" BORDER=3 alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot">
</center></B>

<h3>Invoking of GSAS programs</h3>
When GSAS programs are invoked, in most cases EXPGUI is suspended while 
the GSAS program is run in a terminal (or DOS) window. When the terminal 
window is closed, EXPGUI is restarted. If desired (see the 
<A Href="expguic.html#Autoicon">
"Iconify during GSAS"</A>
option) while this occurs, EXPGUI can be made into an icon 
to save screen space.
<P>
<img src="powpref4a.gif" align=left alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot">
Once the GSAS program has finished, if the program has modified 
the .EXP file, 
<a Href="expguierr.html#Overwrite">
"File has been modified..."</a>message box 
similar to the one to the left is displayed (also see the more complete 
discussion on the <a Href="expguierr.html#Overwrite">messages page</A>.
Note that this message can be avoided if the
<A Href="expguic.html#Autoupdate">
"Autoload EXP"</A>
option is used.
<BR clear=all>
<P>
Note that in both Windows-95 and Windows-NT, a file named <tt>EXPGUI.LCK</tt>
is created while the GSAS program runs. The presence of this file is used 
to suspend the LIVEPLOT program, since LIVEPLOT has sometimes crashed 
when run at the same time as GENLES (no such problem has been seen in Unix). 
This file is deleted when the GSAS program completes.
<P>
<img src="lock.gif" align=left alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot">
In Windows-9x, the <a Href="expgui_Win_readme.html#Winexec">Winexec</a>
package is used to execute a command that creates a DOS window. 
The GSAS programs are then run by a batch file in this DOS window. 
Due to limitations in Tcl/Tk & Windows, the DOS window runs independently
of EXPGUI, so the lock file (<tt>EXPGUI.LCK</tt>) is also used to suspend
EXPGUI. While EXPGUI is waiting, the 
<a Href="expguierr.html#lock">
Please wait...
</a>
window shown to the left is displayed. When the GSAS program completes, the
lock file is deleted, the window automatically disappears and EXPGUI resumes. 
Should a problem arise where the file is not deleted, EXPGUI can be resumed by
pressing the "Continue" button.

but not all, of these features are graphically oriented.

<br clear=all>
<a name="LSTVIEW"></a>
<H3>D.1 LSTVIEW</H3>

<DL><DL>
LSTVIEW is used to browse through the GSAS output listing. It is
invoked by the "lstview" command in the GUI. 
<IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=36 alt="New!">LSTVIEW can also be used
to shorten the .LST file by removing older results from the beginning
of the file.
<IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=36 alt="New!">LSTVIEW can also be used to plot R-factors and parameter shifts
as a function of the cycle number.

<a name="WIDPLT"></a>
<a name="ABSPLT"></a>
<H3>D.5 WIDPLT and ABSPLT</H3>
<DL><DL>
WIDPLT is used to plot the peak widths that are generated by a set
of GSAS profile terms (constant wavelength equations, only). 
The parameters from each phase & histogram will be
read from the .EXP file. It is also possible to input parameters manually.
By creating a special file (<A HREF="expgui_cfg.html#import">
described in the customization information</A>), it
is possible to define reference curves 
that are loaded automatically for comparison.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="widplt.gif" alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot"></CENTER>
<P>
ABSPLT is used to plot the absorption/reflectivity correction for a
histogram. Values are loaded from the histogram(s), but can be edited manually.

WIDPLT and ABSPLT both use the <A href="#blt">BLT</A> graphics package.
</DL></DL>

<br clear=all>
<a name="INSTEDIT"></a>
<H3>D.6 INSTEDIT</H3>
<DL><DL>

The INSTEDIT utility is used to edit or create an instrument parameter file.
The utility can be started from the "Edit File" button in the 
<A HREF="expgui3.html#AddHist">"Add New Histogram"</A> dialog, or from the 
the "instedit" option in the Powder menu. Alternately, to create a new
  instrument parameter file, choose Powder menu option "New InstParm
  file". (It is also possible 
  to create a new file using the standard instedit by selecting
  "Cancel" when asked for an input file.)
An example INSTEDIT window appears below.
<P>
<img SRC="instedit1.gif" align=RIGHT alt="EXPGUI Screen snapshot">
<br clear=all>
<P>
Note that an instrument parameter file is used for a single type of data,
as is selected by the menu button at the top of the window.
However, multiple sets of parameters may be included in a 
file, to be used for example with differing operating modes for the
instrument. Each set of parameters is called a bank in GSAS terminology.
The radiobuttons on the top of the window are used to select 
which bank's parameters will be viewed.
The "Add Bank" button adds an additional bank to the file.
<P>
The parameters are described briefly below, but in more depth in the 
GSAS manual (for example, pages 158-166 for profile parameters and 
page 221-223 for the details of the instrument parameter file.)
<P>
<H5>Bank Parameters</H5>
The parameters available for each bank are:
<DL>
<DT>Title<DD>This probably has no real use.
<DT>Instrument Name<DD>This string is used for creation of CIFs. It is
best if this name is unique for each instrument.
<DT>Primary Wavelength<DD>Note, this value is set automatically when 
the radiation type is selected 
<DT>Zero Correction<DD>This is the shift to be applied to 2theta 
values in centidegrees (degrees/100). This value should probably be
near zero for Debye-Scherrer geometry instruments (unless known from 
calibration) and will almost always be fixed at zero 
for Bragg-Brentano geometry.
<DT>
</DL>
<I>X-ray only parameters</I>
<DL>
<DT>Radiation type<DD>Used with x-rays. The value set here 
determines the anomolous dispersion (f' and f'' values) used.
<DT>Monochromatic/Dual<DD>Used with x-rays. Set to dual when Kalpha1, Kalpha2 
radiation is present.
<DT>Secondary Wavelength<DD>Used in "dual" wavelength mode. 
Note, this value is set automatically when the radiation type is selected 
<DT>Wavelength Ratio<DD>Typically 0.5 for typical K alpha 1,2 instruments,
<<I>i.e.</I>when K alpha 1 is double the intensity of K alpha 2.
<DT>Polarization Correction<DD>There are three modes for this, where the 
first two modes work similarly. The first mode ("Diffracted Beam") 
is most common. The third mode ("None") is used when 
Lorentz-polaraization corrections are applied to the data prior to its input
to GSAS. See page 144-145 in the GSAS manual for more information on these
corrections.
<DT>Polarization Ratio<DD>In "Diffracted Beam" mode: 
typically 0.5 for lab instruments without monochromators and higher for 
instruments with a diffracted beam; the value depends on the monochromator
take-off angle. Typically slightly below unity (0.9-0.98) for synchrotron
instruments. Ask the instrument scientist for the appropriate value.
</DL>
<P>
Each bank in the instrument parameter file has one or more sets of 
profile parameters associated. Set number 1 is the default loaded
when a histogram is added. Increase the number of sets
using the "Add profile" button. Select the optimal profile type 
for use with your data for this set, but for most flexibility, define
default values for all useful profile types (type 1 is of use only for
CW neutron work) and set these values from fitting a standard with 
minimal broodening. Note that profiles can be read from a GSAS experiment 
file using the "Import profile", which raises a dialog 
such as the one below.

<h3>D.7 File Conversions</h3> 
<DL><DL>
<P>
GSAS data, experiment and instrument parameter files are
expected to have a format with exactly 80 characters per line followed 
by a carriage return and then a linefeed (82 characters total per line). 
Files in this format can be read in "Direct Access" mode. 
Recent versions of GSAS will attempt to detect and repair files that
are not in this format, but if the file is incorrectly formatted and 
by chance the length of the file is divisible by 82, the problem in the
file format will not be detected.
The Convert menu
in can be used to convert files into the correct format.
The original version of the 
file is retained and renamed.

Every time a GSAS program (including EXPGUI) is run, an entry is added to 
the "history records" in the .EXP file. After 999 entries have been written,
no more can be added to the file. Further, reading large numbers of history
records can slow the GSAS programs 
(this is less of a problem on faster computers). For these reasons, it may be 
a good idea to prune the older history records from the file.
The File/EraseHistory command can be used to invoke the this option.
<P>
On the dialog the number of history records to be retained is specified. 
Also, after records have been deleted, the remaining records can be renumbered
starting with 1, so that the 999 record limit is not reached.

<h2>E. Coordinate Export & Import Features</h2></a>
EXPGUI can be used to read coordinates in formats not 
supported in GSAS. Coordinates can also be exported in a variety of 
formats as well. 

<A name="import">
<h3>E.1 Coordinate Import Formats</h3> 
Coordinates can be imported using the 
<A HREF="expgui2.html#addphase">"Add Phase"</A>, 
<A HREF="expgui2.html#addatoms">"Add Atoms"</A> or
<A HREF="expgui2.html#replacephase">"Replace Phase"</A> 
buttons on the <A HREF="expgui2.html">Phase Panel</A>, by choosing
the format from the pull-down list to the right of the 
"Import atoms/phase from" button. The formats currently supported
are listed below.
Note that it is relatively easy to add new routines for 
importing coordinates;
see the <A HREF="expgui_cfg.html#import">
customization information</A> for more details.
<DL><DL>
<DT><B>Crystallographic Information File (CIF)</B><DD>
Coordinates can be read from single block or multiblock CIF files
using DDL1. If more than one block containing coordinates is found in the
file, a CIF browser is available to help select the desired block.
<DT><B>PowderCell .CEL files</B><DD>
This format is used by the DOS and Windows PowderCell program, a valuable 
program for the transformation and visualization of structures.
<DT><B>GSAS .EXP files</B><DD>
This routine is used to copy coordinates, unit cell parameters and space group
information from other GSAS experiment (.EXP) files.
<DT><B>MSI .xtl format</B><DD>
<a HREF="#ExportMSI">see below</a>
<DT><B>PLATON .spf (Standard Parameter File) format</B><DD>
<a HREF="#ExportSPF">see below</a>

</DL></DL>

<A name="export">
<h3>E.2 Coordinate Export Formats</h3> 
Coordinates can be written using the Import/Export=>"Coord Export" menu.
Note that contents of the submenu will depend on the 
number of export routines found in the EXPGUI directory when the menu 
is first created, thus it is relatively easy to add new routines for 
importing coordinates;
see the <A HREF="expgui_cfg.html#export">
customization information</A> for more details.
<DL><DL>
<DT><B>Crystallographic Information File (CIF)</B><DD>
Powder Diffraction Crystallographic Information files (pdCIFs) can 
be created by the GSAS2CIF program. The GSAS2CIF menu item 
invokes this program.
<a name="ExportMSI"></a>
<DT><B>MSI .xtl format</B><DD>
This writes a .xtl file, as is used in Insight-II and
Cerius2 (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The routine 
attempts to convert GSAS space group names properly, as well as 
correctly label "Origin 2" setting, however, the naming conversion
will not work for all valid GSAS space groups. Some effort may be needed
by the user to get everything worked out correctly.
<a name="ExportSPF"></a>
<DT><B>PLATON .spf (Standard Parameter File) format</B><DD>
This writes a .spf file, as used in 
<A HREF="http://www.cryst.chem.uu.nl/platon/">Platon</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.cryst.chem.uu.nl/platon/">Pluton</A> by A. L. Spek.
Some attempt is made to get space group naming right, but there is
no assurance of quality here.
<a name="ExportSHELX"></a>
<DT><B>SHELX .ins format</B><DD>
This writes coordinates and symmetry, as used in the SHELX-97 program, and
perhaps as used some other programs, such as CrystalMaker. In addition to 
exporing the coordinates and displacement parameters, the fields that
are generated are TITL, CELL, LATT, SYMM and SFAC. Note that the 
wavelength, included as the first number on the CELL "card", is set to the
arbitrary value of 1/2.

Tcl/Tk</A></H2>
The 
<A Href="http://www.tcl.tk">
Tcl/Tk program</A> is a platform-independent scripting language that is
used to implement most of EXPGUI. This software is available for free
and must be loaded in order to use EXPGUI. A somewhat out of date
version of Tcl/Tk (8.4) is distributed with EXPGUI (ncnrpack.exe, etc.) but
more recent versions can be used, but note that the BLT package (see
below) is needed for all features of EXPGUI.
While learning Tcl/Tk is a great thing to do, it is not a requirement
for using or installing EXPGUI.

<A name=blt>
<H3>
BLT Package</H3>
<UL>
The BLT graphics package is used by the WIDPLT, LIVEPLOT, BKGEDIT & 
EXCLEDT routines. If the
package can not be found by these routines, an error message, 
"Error -- Unable to load the BLT package", will be displayed. It is also 
possible for the package to be installed, but not configured properly. 
If this is the case, a message, 
"BLT Setup Error: could not access a Blt_ routine...", will be displayed.
Use of the ncnrpack file distributed with EXPGUI usually avoids this problem.

<A name=La>
<H3>
La (Linear Algebra) Package</H3>
<UL>
The
<A HREF="http://www.hume.com">Hume 
</A>
Linear Algebra Tcl Package, 
<A HREF="http://www.hume.com/la/la.html">
La</A>, 
is used by the BKGEDIT
routine to perform least-squares fitting. If the
package can not be found, the routine cannot run. 
If the package cannot be found, a message, 
"Error -- Unable to load the La package" will be displayed. This 
should not happen, since the package is included with the EXPGUI files.
So if get this error you probably have an incomplete installation.
</UL>

<A name=winexec>
<H3>
WINEXEC</H3>
<UL>
The WINEXEC package was needed under Windows-95 and its offspring 
(-98 and -ME). It was found in older versions of EXPGUI, but is no
  longer included.
