Installing GSAS/EXPGUI under Mac OS X

This page contains information on installing and running GSAS & EXPGUI
on Macintosh OS X computers. 
<P>
<TABLE BORDER BGCOLOR="#FFFF40" ALIGN=CENTER><TR><TH>
  <B>Please note:</B>
A new mechanism for installing GSAS & EXPGUI is now recommended. See
<A HREF="https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/EXPGUI/wiki/InstallOSX">
this link</a>. If this method is used, EXPGUI or a python script can
be used to update GSAS & EXPGUI quickly and easily.
It is not clear how much longer the installation package described
  below will continute to be updated.
  </TH></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<h2>Installation</H2>
Both GSAS and EXPGUI require that X-windows (X11) be installed on your Mac.
Since 10.3, X11 has been distributed as part of the operating system, but 
for 10.3 and 10.4 must be loaded manually. The instructions below 
describe how X11 is installed.

<OL>
<P><LI>Install X11 (<=10.4, only)
<DL><DL><I>
Before you can run the GSAS package (or, for that matter, 
a large number of other Unix-derived graphics applications), 
you need to load the X Windows system (X11) onto your computer. </I>
<P>
  For 10.5 (Leopard) or 10.6 (Snow Leopard), X11 is installed by
  default. Nothing needs to be done.
  <P>
For 10.4, one can load the Mac OS X from the install disk.
  Note that this requires 
administrator access to the computer. The X11 installation procedure consist 
of the following steps:
<UL>
<LI>On the finder window for the DVD, scroll down and double-click on the Optional Installs icon, which starts the installer. 
<LI>Proceed through the 
windows by pressing Continue (note that X11 must be installed on the boot 
disk). 
<LI>On the package list page, click on the arrow next to Applications 
to open the list, then select X11 to be installed by clicking in the box 
to the left and click Install. 
<LI>The installation then begins. 
<LI>When installation is complete, the X11 package can be run 
from the utilities menu of the system Applications folder.
</UL>
<P>
For 10.3 (Panther) I am pretty sure a similar process to 10.4 can be used, 
but I don't have access to a machine that can boot that OS. Alternately, if you 
have OS X 10.3 on CDROMs, insert CDROM #3 and 
then click on the Packages folder and within that folder, 
click on X11User.pkg. Read the 
installation screens, click on the "next" button a few times, and 
X11 is installed.
<P>
For 10.2 (Jaguar), X11 installation is not simple,
so you will need to do some searching on the web, find a guru or 
consult one of the many Mac OS X books that cover this subject.
One should strongly consider an OS upgrade instead.
</DL></DL>

<P><LI>Download the GSAS & EXPGUI programs as a Mac disk image appropriate 
for the CPU type of your computer (to find out what you have 
click on the "About This Mac" item in the Apple menu) from 
<a href="http://11bm.xray.aps.anl.gov/downloads/gsas/macOSX/">
  http://11bm.xray.aps.anl.gov/downloads/gsas/macOSX/</A>
<P>
<DL><UL>
<LI><I>Newer Macs with Intel (Pentium) CPUs should use the Intel
  version of the .dmg file</I>
<P>
<LI><I>Older Macs with Power PC (G3, G4 or G5) should use the PPC
  version of the .dmg file</I> (Note, as of 2010, this distribution has not
  been updated for a while).
<P>

While you can run GSAS & EXPGUI from this location, you are strongly 
suggested to instead copy the entire package to your computer by dragging the 
gsas folder icon to another finder window, or by clicking on it and using 
Copy and Paste.
</UL>
<LI>Install a "shortcut" to launch EXPGUI
<DL><DL>
<IMG SRC="expgui_osx.jpg" ALT="EXPGUI AppleScript icon" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The OS X version of GSAS & EXPGUI has an EXPGUI AppleScript application 
named <tt>expgui.app</tt> in the gsas folder with the icon shown 
to the right. This AppleScript will start X11, 
if needed and then lauch EXPGUI. (If you have ideas for improving the script, 
the code can be found in file expgui_applescript.txt.)
The EXPGUI AppleScript can be used in three ways:
<UL>
<P><LI>Double-clicking on the icon will launch EXPGUI so that it starts 
with the "file open" window in your home directory. This 
window can then be used to navigate to 
access/create experiments in other folders.
<P><LI>Dropping one or more GSAS Experiment (.EXP) files onto the EXPGUI icon
will cause the experiment files to be opened. If more than one file is dropped,
each file will open in a separate EXPGUI session. 
<P><LI>Dropping one or more folders onto the EXPGUI icon will cause EXPGUI to be 
started with the "file open" window in that folder.
</UL>
<P>
If you will use GSAS a fair amount, you will likely 
find it convenient to drag the EXPGUI icon to the dock
for easy access.
<P>
Note, that this <B><U>EXPGUI app will not 
work correctly if copied or moved to another folder</U></B>. 
It must be located 
in the gsas folder along with all the other files and 
subdirectories needed by GSAS & EXPGUI -- you can instead 
create an alias (by highlighting the AppleScript icon in the Finder 
and using the File/"Make alias" menu item or the Command-L shortcut). An alias 
created in this fashion can be moved wherever desired -- for example, to 
the desktop or to the Application folder.
</DL></DL>

<LI>For Unix power users: Make a command line shortcut (optional)
<DL><DL>
<I>People who have not become completely enlighted to the Mac may wish to 
set up a way to type something (gasp!) in a terminal window that will allow
them to start EXPGUI. There are a number of ways this can be done,
(see section 2.2 in the 
<A Href="expgui_Unix_readme.html">Unix installation notes</A>.)
Also, on the Mac it is possible to add applications to the X11 Applications 
menu, by using the Applications/Customize menu option. 
Note that the command used to start Tcl/Tk and EXPGUI will vary depending 
on where you installed the package. I install the package in ~/Applications
so the command string to start EXPGUI is:</I> 
<PRE>
          ~/Applications/gsas/ncnrpack-osx  ~/Applications/gsas/expgui/expgui
</PRE>
</DL></DL>

</OL>

<h4>EXPGUI Enhancements specific to the Mac</H4>

EXPGUI will automatically designate the EXPGUI AppleScript 
as the "open with" application for every GSAS experiment (.EXP) file 
that is read or written by EXPGUI. This is done with the 
Development Tools program Rez, found in /Developer/Tools or in the gsas folder.
At the same time, EXPGUI will also set an icon for the .EXP file. 
After this has been done, EXPGUI can be invoked by simply double-clicking on 
a GSAS experiment file (.EXP file) icon.
<P>
If for some reason you would prefer this not be done 
(I would be interested to hear why) -- deselect the 
"Assign app to .EXP files" checkbox in the Options menu.

<HR noshade><HR noshade>
<h4>Mac ideosyncracies</H4>
<P>
Unlike in the Windows & Unix versions of GSAS, Mac windows may not be updated
until they are brought to the top of the screen by clicking on them
(given focus). This is most noticible for PGPLOT 
graphics (in POWPLOT, RAWPLOT,...). 
When you type graphics commands in a terminal window, the plot does not 
appear to change. However, click on the PGPLOT's window bar and the plot will 
update.

<HR noshade><HR noshade>
<h4>The Tcl/Tk Starkit</H4>
<P>
The GSAS-EXPGUI distribution now includes a single file version of the 
entire Tcl/Tk package, as well as a graphics package for Tcl/Tk, called
BLT, that is used extensively within EXPGUI. The inclusion of this file
within the package simplifies installation considerably. 
This single 3 Mb file, 
<tt>gsas/ncnrpack_osx</tt>, contains many other Tcl/Tk packages (that are 
not used within EXPGUI) and may be of value for use with other applications.
Note that the EXPGUI AppleScript will look for Tcl/Tk first as the
<tt>ncnrpack_osx</tt> file in the same folder as where the <tt>expgui.app</tt> 
script is located. If this <tt>ncnrpack_osx</tt> 
file is deleted, renamed or moved, 
then the script will look for the standard Tcl/Tk program (<tt>wish</tt>) in the
<tt>/sw/bin</tt> directory.
<HR noshade><HR noshade>

<h4>Problems</H4>
If you cannot get EXPGUI or the GSAS graphics programs to work, 
you may have a setup problem with X-windows (X11). 
One common reason for this is that X11 must be restarted any time 
your computer's hostname changes, which may be caused by starting/stopping 
networking, dialing in for e-mail or even by a change in 
IP address initiated by the network DHCP server, if you are hardwired into 
a network. 

If exiting and restarting X11 does not address your problem, 
the following paragraphs
may help you diagnose problems.
<OL><LI>
One possible problem is the definition for the X11 display (shell
environment variable DISPLAY). 
On my machine, this variable seems to be set correctly in X11 xterm windows, 
but is not set by default within an Aqua terminal window unless
you make changes to your shell startup. 
<P>
A quick test for X11 problems is to type xclock at the shell prompt:

<PRE>
     bash-2.05a$ xclock
</PRE>
If you get a clock display -- great, X windows is working!
<P>
If you get the following error message
the DISPLAY variable is not set: 
<PRE>
     bash-2.05a$ xclock
     Error: Can't open display: 
</PRE>

If on the other hand, you get this error message, there is a 
security problem with X windows:
<PRE>
     bash-2.05a$ xclock
     Error: Can't open display: localhost:0.0
</PRE>
This will most likely be solved by exiting and restarting X11 (see above).
<P>
You can set the DISPLAY variable in bash/zsh, etc. using:
<PRE>
     bash-2.05a$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
</PRE>

or in csh/tcsh, etc. using:

<PRE>
     [d120234:~] toby% setenv DISPLAY localhost:0.0
</PRE>
(For info on how to do this automatically, see step 2 in 
<a href="http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/xtal/page1.html"
>http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/xtal/page1.html</A>).
<P><LI>
A second possible problem relates to the installation of the 
Tcl/Tk and BLT packages. This problem seems unlikely, now that 
the Tcl/Tk package is included in the distribution, but if you have 
removed the ncnrpack_osx file from the gsas folder, the expgui.app AppleScript
will try to use wish installed in /sw/bin. If you are choosing to do this,
you can test if Tcl/Tk and the BLT package are installed correctly using the 
following commands:
<PRE>
     [d120234:~] toby% wish
     % package require BLT
     2.4
     % pack [blt::graph .g]
     % exit
</PRE>
When you type "wish" and press Enter, a new small blank window should appear.
when you type the 2nd line, "package require BLT," there will be no change in
the blank window, but the computer should respond "2.4". After the 
"pack [blt::graph .g]" command is entered, a set of x- and y-axes should appear
in this window. The window should disappear after "exit" is typed.
