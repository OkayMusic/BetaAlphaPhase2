<B>Please note:</B>
A new mechanism for installing GSAS & EXPGUI is now recommended. See
<A HREF="https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/EXPGUI/wiki/InstallLinux">
this link</a>. If this method is used, EXPGUI or a python script can
be used to update GSAS & EXPGUI quickly and easily. The information
below is all obsolete.
Also, GSAS updates for the Silicon Graphics have not been produced for
many years.
</TH></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR=ALL>

Note that root access is not required to load this GSAS/EXPGUI package.
You may choose to do this work as root, so that the files may be installed 
a central location (such as <tt>/usr/local</tt>).

<H2>1. Prerequisites</H2>

Installation of GSAS & EXPGUI requires X windows, which is loaded with 
the operating system on virtually all Linux and SGI systems. 
It also requires only the shared libraries typically found on standard 
install configurations (tell me if I am wrong). 
The Linux version is compiled with g77 v2.96 on a Redhat 7.1 machine.
It should be compatible with most modern versions of Linux.
The SGI version has been compiled with f77 on a SGI running IRIX 6.5. It should
be compatible with most recent versions of IRIX.
<IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=36 alt="New!">
This GSAS & EXPGUI is now distributed with a version of Tcl/Tk, 
so installation of Tcl/Tk is no longer a prerequisite.

<H2>2. Download the GSAS/EXPGUI Distribution</H2>
<I>Make a note of where you download the file. In the following section
it will be assumed the file was placed in</I> <tt>/tmp/</tt>.

<P>
<H2>
3. Unpack the distribution</H2>
<I>In this step,
it is assumed that you downloaded the distribution file in
directory</I> <tt>/tmp/</tt>.

<UL>
<LI>Determine a directory where the software should be installed.
<I>If you do not have root access, this will likely be in your 
own working area, typically</I> <tt>/usr/people/</tt>account 
<I>or</I> <tt>/home/</tt>account. Note that the files will be 
placed in a subdirectory named <tt>gsas</tt> in this location.
<pre>
      cd 
      mkdir Programs
      cd Programs
</Pre>
or
<pre>
      cd /usr/local
</Pre>

<LI>Expand the files:
<P><DL>
<DT>SGI, use command 
<DD><PRE>gunzip < /tmp/SGI_gsas+expgui.tar.gz | tar xvf -</PRE>
<DT>LINUX, use command 
<DD><PRE>tar xvzf /tmp/LINUX_gsas+expgui.tar.gz</PRE>
</DL>
</UL>

<H2>
4. Installing a shortcut to EXPGUI</H2>
While it is possible to invoke EXPGUI by typing
<FONT FACE="COURIER"><PRE>
    /usr/local/gsas/tcltk84+ /usr/local/gsas/expgui/expgui
</PRE></FONT>
or 
<FONT FACE="COURIER"><PRE>
   /home/toby/myprogs/gsas/tcltk84+ /home/toby/myprogs/gsas/expgui/expgui
</PRE></FONT>
(etc.) this would get old fast. Rather, you will likely want to 
create an easier command to type. 
Below are three ways to do this. Note that only one is needed. Do not use all 
three. You could also create a startbar or desktop icon that can be clicked
to start EXPGUI.
The way this is done depends on how your system is set up and cannot 
be described here.

<em>Note that in the commands below, it is assumed that 
GSAS has been installed in <tt>/myprogs/gsas</tt>.
Also, note that in the commands below, 
</em><FONT FACE="COURIER">^D</FONT><em> means control-D.</em>


<UL><H4>
4.1 Installing an alias for EXPGUI</H4>
<P>
One way to create a easy way to invoke EXPGUI is to add an alias to your 
default shell.
First, determine what shell you are using. Type
<PRE>
    echo $SHELL
</PRE>

The response will likely be something like /usr/bin/bash (the bash shell) or 
/usr/bin/tcsh (the tcsh shell).
<P>
<DL>
<DT>If you use tcsh or csh:
<DD>to add an alias to your ~/.cshrc file, type these commands
(change <tt>/myprogs</tt> as needed):
<FONT FACE="COURIER"><PRE>
         cat >> ~/.cshrc
         alias expgui "/myprogs/gsas/tcltk84+ /myprogs/gsas/expgui/expgui"
         ^D
</PRE></FONT>

<DT>If you use bash:
<DD>to add an alias to your ~/.bash_profile, type these commands
(change <tt>/myprogs</tt> as needed):
<FONT FACE="COURIER"><PRE>
         cat >> ~/.bash_profile
         alias expgui="/myprogs/gsas/tcltk84+ /myprogs/gsas/expgui/expgui"
         ^D
</PRE></FONT>
</DL>

<H4>
4.2 Installing EXPGUI in the path</H4>
<P>
Another way to simplify access to EXPGUI 
is to create a file that will invoke the GUI script. 
The file must be placed in a directory in your path and 
flagged as executable. You can examine the directories in your path by typing:
<PRE>
    echo $PATH
</PRE>
Also, check to see that you do not alreay have expgui command in your path
by typing:
<PRE>
    which expgui
</PRE>
You should get a response "expgui not found in...". A response of 
<tt>/usr/bin/expgui</tt> tells you there is already a shortcut to expgui
in that location. Either replace it or choose a name other than expgui.
<P>
The commands to create this executable file will be:
<FONT FACE="COURIER"><PRE>
        cat > /usr/bin/expgui
	/myprogs/gsas/tcltk84+ /myprogs/gsas/expgui/expgui
        ^D
        chmod +x /usr/bin/expgui
</PRE></FONT>
(change <tt>/myprogs</tt> and <tt>/usr/bin</tt> as needed).

<I>Note that this step (4.2) is incompatible with the one below (4.3).</I>
<H4>
4.3 Linking EXPGUI into the path</H4>
<P>
Another way to simplify access to EXPGUI 
is to create a link in your system's path to the GUI script.
First, you will need to edit the 3rd line in the EXPGUI script from
<PRE>
      exec wish "$0" "$@"
</PRE>
to 
<PRE>
      exec /myprogs/gsas/tcltk84+ "$0" "$@"
</PRE>
(change <tt>/myprogs</tt> as needed).
Then you will create a link using:
                ln -s /myprogs/gsas/expgui/expgui /usr/bin/expgui
</PRE></FONT>
<I>Note that this step (4.3) is incompatible with the one above (4.2).</I>

<H2>Updating to a new GSAS release</H2>
<DL><DL>
It is quite common that Bob Von Dreele will release an update to the
GSAS programs more frequently than the combination gsas+expgui
is updated. It is possible to update only the
GSAS software. 
To determine the date of the GSAS package release, 
run a GSAS program, such as EXPEDT or SPACEGRP and note the 
date where it says "Distributed on ..."
To update,
first determine where you have installed the GSAS/EXPGUI software
(<tt>/myprogs</tt> in the previous example). 
You will want to install the GSAS distribution to the <tt>gsas</tt> 
subdirectory in that location.
Then download the latest GSAS release from CCP14:
<DL>

</DL>
<P>Select and download the appropriate gsaskit.tar.gz (making sure that the 
listing date is significantly later than the distribution date 
you currently have).
Then use commands like this:

<P><DL>
<DT>SGI, use command 
<DD><PRE>
cd /myprogs/gsas
gunzip < /tmp/gsaskit.tar.gz | tar xvf -</PRE>
<DT>LINUX, use command 
<DD><PRE>
cd /myprogs/gsas
tar xvzf /tmp/gsaskit.tar.gz</PRE>
</DL>
<P>
Finally, check that GSAS has indeed been updated by 
again running a GSAS program, such as EXPEDT or SPACEGRP and noting the 
date where it says "Distributed on ..."
</DL></DL>

<H2>Updating to a new EXPGUI release</H2>
<DL><DL>
It is also common that new features will be added to EXPGUI or 
bug fixes will be made without an update to the
combination gsas+expgui
package. 
The absolute latest release (which may not have gotten 
a lot of testing)
is distributed as 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/expgui_ALPHA.tar.gz">
ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/expgui_ALPHA.tar.gz</A>.
You can find the number of the latest alpha release by looking at file
<A Href="http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/xtal/software/expgui/alpha/wishlist.html">
http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/xtal/software/expgui/alpha/wishlist.html</A>
<P>
To update,
first determine where you have installed the GSAS/EXPGUI software
(<tt>/myprogs</tt> in the previous example). 
You will want to install the GSAS distribution to the <tt>gsas/expgui</tt> 
subdirectory in that location.
Second, note the EXPGUI package date, by 
using the Help/About menu command in EXPGUI.
You then want to download this file:
<DL>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/expgui_ALPHA.tar.gz">
ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/cryst/gsas/expgui_ALPHA.tar.gz</A>
<BR>
(for mirrors, select file expgui_ALPHA.tar.gz from CCP14 sites in 
<A HREF="

and unpack it to subdirectory <tt>.../gsas/expgui/</tt>
using commands like this:

<P><DL>
<DT>SGI:
<DD><PRE>
cd /myprogs/gsas/expgui
gunzip < /tmp/expgui_ALPHA.tar.gz | tar xvf -</PRE>

RPMs for GSAS/EXPGUI are not being updated</H2>
I am no longer preparing an RPM distribution for GSAS & EXPGUI. This 
is because it was getting increasingly hard to find RPM distributions 
for Tcl/Tk and BLT. If one has to install & build these packages from
source code, then one must also override the RPM package tracking
system to install the GSAS & EXPGUI RPM. 
The current method, which includes the entire Tcl/Tk package is 
easier to deal with.
<P>
<h2>The Tcl/Tk Starkit</H2>
<P>
The GSAS-EXPGUI distribution now includes a single file version of the 
entire Tcl/Tk package, as well as a graphics package for Tcl/Tk, called
BLT, that is used extensively within EXPGUI. The inclusion of this file
within the package simplifies installation considerably. 
This file,
<tt>tcltk84+</tt>, contains many other Tcl/Tk packages (that are 
not used within EXPGUI), but may be of value for use with other applications.

<a name="testtcltk"></a><H2>
Using other versions of Tcl/Tk</H2>
If you have another version of Tcl/Tk installed on your computer, 
it must also have the BLT package installed and configured properly. 
To confirm this 
software is installed and working correctly on your system 
try the following commands. (Commands you type are in this <font face="courier">typewriter</font> 
font, computer responses are this <font face="courier"><I>italic font</I></font>.
